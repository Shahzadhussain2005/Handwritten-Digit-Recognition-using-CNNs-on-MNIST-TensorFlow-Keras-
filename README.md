# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNNs-on-MNIST-TensorFlow-Keras-
Built a CNN-based handwritten digit recognition model using TensorFlow and Keras on the MNIST dataset. Performed data preprocessing, normalization, and model optimization with dropout and early stopping. Achieved ~98–99% accuracy with strong generalization and evaluation metrics.
